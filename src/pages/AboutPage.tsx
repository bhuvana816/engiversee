              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Engiversee was founded in 2024 with a clear vision: to create a collaborative platform where engineering students can learn, grow, and excel in their academic and professional journeys.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                We recognized a gap between theoretical education provided in colleges and the practical skills needed in the industry. This realization led us to establish Engiversee as a bridge between these two worlds.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                Today, we are a growing community of passionate educators, industry professionals, and students working together to make quality education and career guidance accessible to all.
